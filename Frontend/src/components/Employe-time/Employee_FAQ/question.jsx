        question:"Does Toggl Track track GPS and take screenshots?" ,
        answer: "Toggl Track stands against employee surveillance and micromanagement. Monitoring has never been a feature in our software nor our culture—and it never will be. Toggl Track is not for managers who are trying to snoop. We will never have features for screen recording, location tracking, keystroke tracking, or webcam monitoring. We don't spy on our employees here at Toggl Track, and we think you shouldn't either.Read more about why we don't believe in surveillance here.",
